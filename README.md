I'm Jonathan Parker, a Student in Computer Science at Southern Arkansas University. 
I'm a tinkerer at heart, whether it be my 3d printer or my linux install. 

Decent enough at python and using the Django framework more and more every day.
Always looking to learn.

My email is jonathanparkb@gmail.com
